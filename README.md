Turbo Pascal Compiler
---------------------

This is a Node.js and web-based Pascal compiler and UCSD p-code interpreter that runs a subset of Turbo Pascal 5.5 code.

See the [full write-up](http://www.teamten.com/lawrence/projects/turbo_pascal_compiler/) or
[try it now](http://mikeralphson.github.io/turbopascal/)!

To run the compiler from the command-line use the `turbo` command. This uses `tpc.js` which is a shell around the actual compiler and runtime.

To run the web version locally, run the "arapaho" script to start a web server and go to
http://localhost:3000

Go to http://localhost:3000/unit.html to run the unit tests.
